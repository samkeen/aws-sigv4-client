Still in POC phase (working but duct-taped)

Goal
****

This will be a Python alternative to the SDK's auto generated by AWS Gateway.  It's core features is the ability to manage AWS temporary credentials aquired from `STS <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/STS/latest/APIReference/Welcome.html>`_, via `Cognito Identity <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/mobile/sdkforios/developerguide/cognito-auth.html>`_.

It will have the ability to gain credentials (via traditional login), store them locally to make calls to authenticated API Gateway endpoints and obtain new credential when the current ones expire.
